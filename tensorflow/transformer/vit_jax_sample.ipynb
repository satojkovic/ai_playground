        "In this tutorial, we will take a closer look at a recent new trend: Transformers for Computer Vision. Since [Alexey Dosovitskiy et al.](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=YicbFdNTTy) successfully applied a Transformer on a variety of image recognition benchmarks, there have been an incredible amount of follow-up works showing that CNNs might not be optimal architecture for Computer Vision anymore. But how do Vision Transformers work exactly, and what benefits and drawbacks do they offer in contrast to CNNs? We will answer these questions by implementing a Vision Transformer ourselves and train it on the popular, small dataset CIFAR10. We will compare these results to the convolutional architectures of [Tutorial 5](https://uvadlc-notebooks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_notebooks/JAX/tutorial5/Inception_ResNet_DenseNet.html). \n",

        "\n",
        "Transformers have been originally proposed to process sets since it is a permutation-equivariant architecture, i.e., producing the same output permuted if the input is permuted. To apply Transformers to sequences, we have simply added a positional encoding to the input feature vectors, and the model learned by itself what to do with it. So, why not do the same thing on images? This is exactly what [Alexey Dosovitskiy et al.](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=YicbFdNTTy) proposed in their paper \"An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale\". Specifically, the Vision Transformer is a model for image classification that views images as sequences of smaller patches. As a preprocessing step, we split an image of, for example, $48\\times 48$ pixels into 9 $16\\times 16$ patches. Each of those patches is considered to be a \"word\"/\"token\" and projected to a feature space. With adding positional encodings and a token for classification on top, we can apply a Transformer as usual to this sequence and start training it for our task. A nice GIF visualization of the architecture is shown below (figure credit - [Phil Wang](https://github.com/lucidrains/vit-pytorch/blob/main/images/vit.gif)):\n",

Further, we use the Pre-Layer Normalization version of the Transformer blocks proposed by [Ruibin Xiong et al.](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v119/xiong20b/xiong20b.pdf) in 2020. The idea is to apply Layer Normalization not in between residual blocks, but instead as a first layer in the residual blocks. This reorganization of the layers supports better gradient flow and removes the necessity of a warm-up stage. A visualization of the difference between the standard Post-LN and the Pre-LN version is shown below.\n",

When creating this notebook, we have performed a small grid search over hyperparameters and listed the best hyperparameters in the cell below. Nevertheless, it is worth discussing the influence that each hyperparameter has, and what intuition we have for choosing its value.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, let's consider the patch size. The smaller we make the patches, the longer the input sequences to the Transformer become. While in general, this allows the Transformer to model more complex functions, it requires a longer computation time due to its quadratic memory usage in the attention layer. Furthermore, small patches can make the task more difficult since the Transformer has to learn which patches are close-by, and which are far away. We experimented with patch sizes of 2, 4, and 8 which gives us the input sequence lengths of 256, 64, and 16 respectively. We found 4 to result in the best performance and hence pick it below. \n",
        "\n",
        "Next, the embedding and hidden dimensionality have a similar impact on a Transformer as to an MLP. The larger the sizes, the more complex the model becomes, and the longer it takes to train. In Transformers, however, we have one more aspect to consider: the query-key sizes in the Multi-Head Attention layers. Each key has the feature dimensionality of `embed_dim/num_heads`. Considering that we have an input sequence length of 64, a minimum reasonable size for the key vectors is 16 or 32. Lower dimensionalities can restrain the possible attention maps too much. We observed that more than 8 heads are not necessary for the Transformer, and therefore pick an embedding dimensionality of `256`. The hidden dimensionality in the feed-forward networks is usually 2-4x larger than the embedding dimensionality, and thus we pick `512`. \n",

        "Finally, the learning rate for Transformers is usually relatively small, and in papers, a common value to use is 3e-5. However, since we work with a smaller dataset and have a potentially easier task, we found that we are able to increase the learning rate to 3e-4 without any problems. To reduce overfitting, we use a dropout value of 0.2. Remember that we also use small image augmentations as regularization during training.\n",

This is a considerable gap and shows that although Vision Transformers perform strongly on ImageNet with potential pretraining, they cannot come close to simple CNNs on CIFAR10 when being trained from scratch.

While the learning rate might have an influence on the initial learning speed, we see the same trend in the validation accuracy. The ResNet achieves the best performance of the Vision Transformer after just 5 epochs (2000 iterations). Further, while the ResNet training loss and validation accuracy have a similar trend, the validation performance of the Vision Transformers only marginally changes after 10k iterations while the training loss has almost just started going down. Yet, the Vision Transformer is also able to achieve close to 100% accuracy on the training set.\n",

        "All those observed phenomenons can be explained with a concept that we have visited before: inductive biases. Convolutional Neural Networks have been designed with the assumption that images are translation invariant. Hence, we apply convolutions with shared filters across the image. Furthermore, a CNN architecture integrates the concept of distance in an image: two pixels that are close to each other are more related than two distant pixels. Local patterns are combined into larger patterns until we perform our classification prediction. All those aspects are inductive biases of a CNN. In contrast, a Vision Transformer does not know which two pixels are close to each other, and which are far apart. It has to learn this information solely from the sparse learning signal of the classification task. This is a huge disadvantage when we have a small dataset since such information is crucial for generalizing to an unseen test dataset. With large enough datasets and/or good pre-training, a Transformer can learn this information without the need for inductive biases, and instead is more flexible than a CNN. Especially long-distance relations between local patterns can be difficult to process in CNNs, while in Transformers, all patches have the distance of one. This is why Vision Transformers are so strong on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet but underperform a lot when being applied to a small dataset such as CIFAR10. "

        "In this tutorial, we have implemented our own Vision Transformer from scratch and applied it to the task of image classification. Vision Transformers work by splitting an image into a sequence of smaller patches, use those as input to a standard Transformer encoder. While Vision Transformers achieved outstanding results on large-scale image recognition benchmarks such as ImageNet, they considerably underperform when being trained from scratch on small-scale datasets like CIFAR10. The reason is that in contrast to CNNs, Transformers do not have the inductive biases of translation invariance and the feature hierarchy (i.e. larger patterns consist of many smaller patterns). However, these aspects can be learned when enough data is provided, or the model has been pre-trained on other large-scale tasks. Considering that Vision Transformers have just been proposed end of 2020, there is likely a lot more to come on Transformers for Computer Vision.\n",
